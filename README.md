## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. Use this to run just the front-end stand-alone

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm start-backend`

### `npm start-all`

Uses concurrently and runs the web-application and the backend express server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). Use this to run the whole development project

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
